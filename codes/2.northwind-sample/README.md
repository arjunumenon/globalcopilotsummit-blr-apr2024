# M365 Copilot Teams Messaging Extension - Northwind Inventory

This is a demo code sample for the Microsoft 365 Copilot extension for Teams Messaging Extensions. It is a simple example that uses the Northwind database to demonstrate how to use the messaging extension as a Plugin for Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18.x](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.18.2/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
- You will need a Microsoft work or school account with [permissions to upload custom Teams applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading). The account will also need a Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 license to use the extension in Copilot.

## Setup and use the sample

For instructions on setting up and running the sample, see the [lab exercises](./lab/Exercise%2000%20-%20Welcome.md).

## Example prompts for Copilot

Here are some ideas for prompts to try. If you don't get the result you expect, try typing "new chat" and then trying again.
